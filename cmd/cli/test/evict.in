# Test evict command - error handling for non-remote buckets
# Evict only works on remote buckets (s3://, gs://, etc.)

# Test 1: Attempt to evict from AIS bucket (should fail)
ais bucket create ais://$BUCKET // IGNORE
echo "test1" > /tmp/$RANDOM_1.txt
ais put /tmp/$RANDOM_1.txt ais://$BUCKET/obj1.txt // IGNORE
ais evict ais://$BUCKET/obj1.txt // FAIL "evicting objects from AIS buckets"

# Test 2: Attempt to evict entire AIS bucket (should fail)
ais evict ais://$BUCKET // FAIL "evicting objects from AIS buckets"

# Cleanup
rm -f /tmp/$RANDOM_1.txt // IGNORE
ais bucket rm ais://$BUCKET -y // IGNORE
